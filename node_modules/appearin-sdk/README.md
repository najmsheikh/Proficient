## Installing

You can add this library to your browserify/whatever is cool these days package by doing:

`npm install appearin-sdk`

Alternatively, you can fetch link to the sources directly at the bottom of you body:

`<script src="//developer.appear.in/scripts/appearin-sdk.0.0.4.min.js"></script>`

You can read more on the appear.in API at our [developer pages](https://developer.appear.in).

[Documentation can be found at our developer pages too](https://developer.appear.in/#javascript-sdk-documentation).

# Development
*This section is only here for those manually going to the GitHub
repository and want to build/hack it themselves.*

The project uses browserify to compile the sources. A test page has been added
as index.html to verify that the core functionality is working. Hopefully this
will be replaced by automated tests soonâ„¢.

To start off, run `npm install` to fetch dependencies.

To compile the latest sources do `grunt dev`.

## Building outside NPM
Building outside NPM is done by doing `grunt build`. This will create three files:

````
appearin-sdk.<version>.js
appearin-sdk.<version>.min.js
appearin-sdk.<version>.min.js.map
````

These can be self hosted, and they contain all dependencies necessary,
including wrapping with browserify-standalone.
